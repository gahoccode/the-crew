## 5. Visualizations:
To provide clear visual context for the data, below are a series of graphs illustrating REE's operational trends over these six years. 

- **Revenue and Profit Trends**:
  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  years = [2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019]
  revenue = [8394.60, 8579.35, 9377.95, 5815.21, 5644.09, 4896.70]
  profit = [2396.00, 2786.66, 3515.38, 2135.41, 1713.50, 1719.92]

  plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
  plt.plot(years, revenue, marker='o', label='Revenue (Bn. VND)', color='blue')
  plt.plot(years, profit, marker='o', label='Net Profit (Bn. VND)', color='green')
  plt.title("REE Revenue and Net Profit Trends")
  plt.xlabel("Year")
  plt.ylabel("Value in Bn. VND")
  plt.xticks(years)
  plt.legend()
  plt.grid()
  plt.show()
  ```

- **Liquidity Ratios**:
  ```python
  liquidity_ratios = {
      'Current Ratio': [2.77, 2.41, 2.10, 1.68, 1.74, 1.83],
      'Quick Ratio': [2.33, 1.91, 1.46, 1.20, 1.21, 1.14],
  }

  plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
  plt.plot(years, liquidity_ratios['Current Ratio'], marker='o', label='Current Ratio', color='orange')
  plt.plot(years, liquidity_ratios['Quick Ratio'], marker='o', label='Quick Ratio', color='red')
  plt.title("REE Liquidity Ratios")
  plt.xlabel("Year")
  plt.ylabel("Ratio")
  plt.xticks(years)
  plt.legend()
  plt.grid()
  plt.show()
  ```

## 6. Investment Insights:
- Given the fluctuations in profitability, the decreasing trend in ROE, and the liquidity ratios remaining strong, REE could remain a viable option for conservative investors focusing on stability.
- The slowdown in profit margins may require attention and strategies to enhance profitability.
  
### Recommendations:
- Explore operational efficiencies to improve profit margins.
- Maintain strong liquidity while strategically managing debt levels.
- Consider enhancing revenue-generating avenues to offset losses in net profit.

This comprehensive analysis should guide investors in making informed decisions regarding REE's stock performance and future viability.
